The best language for Android app development is Kotlin. It is the preferred language recommended by Google for Android development due to its modern features, safety, and interoperability with Java. Java is also widely used and supported, but Kotlin offers more concise syntax and improved performance for many tasks. If you're starting a new project, Kotlin would be the best choice.
can you write a simple app in kotlin that will show my latitude and longitude on the screen?
Sure! Below is a simple example of an Android app written in Kotlin that shows your 
latitude and   longitude on the screen. This example uses the Fused Location Provider API to get the device's location.

Users will be able to register with a username and password, also an email for password resets.
the pictures will remain on the server for 30 days, and then be deleted.

the app will also be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is free of bugs and glitches.
